				In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has been raging worldwide. Despite its rapid spread, people around the world are doing their best to fight this new virus. 
				Itâ€™s an unprecedented challenge for every country: How to keep people safe from a global pandemic while trying to minimize economic losses.
				Most importantly, coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. People are told to be cautious about having signs of infection 
				include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. 
				Governments and organizations have given out recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

				In this outbreak, many people were unable to stay at home. They must stick to their posts to maintain the operation of the 
				city and the normal life of the citizens. These groups include medical staff, scientific researchers, police security personnel, as well as 
				transport drivers, courier, and cleaning staff. While ordinary people staying at home because of the lockdown are also trying 
				to maintain confidence and passion for life. They are bringing happiness and comfort to their families and neighbors, 
				and they are also worthy of respect

				My name is Neng Pan, a first year MSI student in University of Michigan. The original intention of this website is to 
				record and commemorate everything that happened in this virus epidemic. I hope that every visitor can get strength and faith 
				from these faces and figures, and can often think of them in life from now on, always being moved and inspired by all of them.
